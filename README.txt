Hammer Time
=========== 

A point-and-click game by Ivan Hromada. 

Installing and Running
---------------------- 

Working on making executable. In the mean time, 
you will need to install Python 3 and Pygame. 
To run the game from the windows console, go to game directory and type: run_HT.py. If it 
doesn't work you will need to set PATH. 

Playing
------- 

Control the hammer with your mouse and left-click 
to hit the squirrel. You have to be fast or 
you'll miss the squirrel. You only have six 
chances to miss. The high score will be shown 
on the start screen.
